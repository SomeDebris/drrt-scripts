Schedule Statistics
-------------------

          #: number of matches played, a '+' after the number
               indicates one additional round as a surrogate
          d: minimum delta between matches (e.g. '1' means back-to-back)
       part: number of distinct partners followed by most frequent repeat count
        opp: number of distinct opponents followed by most frequent repeat count
       both: number of distinct teams seen as partner or opponent
               followed by most frequent combined repeat count
        r/b: balance between red and blue alliance appearances
               eg, 3b means team appeared as blue 3 times more than as red
        <->: number of swaps between alliances (ie, bumper color changes)
      s1...: number of appearances at station 1, etc.
 4+ repeats: any teams seen four or more times as partners or opponents

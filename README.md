# DRRT Scripts

This repository contains all utilities written for the Debris Regional
Reassembly Tournament (DRRT) series. These utilities simplify the following tasks:
- Creation of red and blue alliance fleet files for the Qualifications, according to a high-quality match schedule
- Run the FRC MatchMaker program many times and format the output as CSV
- Reduce ship and fleet files only to essential fields; prevent block redefinitions and reduce file size
- Parse Reassembly MLOGs, rank ships according to DRRT rules, and send the data to a Google sheet.
